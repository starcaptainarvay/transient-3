# Workflower

The `workflower` library is designed to create and manage a directed graph of computational cells, allowing conditional branching based on the return values of cell functions. This library is useful for workflows, state machines, or any process where the flow of execution can change dynamically.

## Key Concepts and Components

### WorkflowerOptions
```lua
{
    'entry', -- first cell that gets called
    {'entry', 'node2', 'node3', ...} --[[ 
        order of cells to call, although this can change dynamically based on the 
        first return value of each cell to create more complex state machines
    ]] 

    entry = entry_function: function,
    node2 = node2_function: function,
    ...
}
```
Defines the structure of the options table that initializes the workflower. It includes an entry point and a graph structure that specifies the order and possible branches of cells.

### Workflower Class
The main class that represents the directed graph of computational cells. It includes methods to create a new instance, add cells, retrieve cells, and execute the workflow.

### Cells
Individual computational steps within the workflower. Each cell has an identifier and a function that performs the computation and can return the next cell to execute.

### Bucket Class
A simple state wrapper that can store and retrieve values during the workflow execution. It can be used to capture intermediate results without disrupting the flow.

### Pipe Class
Represents a function that processes data and passes it to the next cell in the workflow.

## Installation

Include the `workflower` library in your project by copying the files into your project directory.

## Usage

### Creating a New Workflower Instance

You can create a new workflower instance by specifying the entry point and the graph structure. The graph structure defines the order and possible branches of the cells.

```lua
local workflower = require("workflower")

local wf = workflower({
    "start", -- index [1] will always be the entry point
    {"start", "process", "end"}, -- index [2] will always be the directed graph of the flow
    
    ['start'] = start -- this is a function that takes the initial input,
    ['process'] = process -- this is a function that takes the output from 'start',
    ['end'] = finish -- this is a function that takes the output from 'process'
})
```

### Adding and Retrieving Cells

Cells can be added to the workflower with specific identifiers and functions. These functions define what each cell does and how it determines the next cell to execute.

```lua
local function start(...)
    print("Starting", ...)
    return "process", ...
end

local function process(...)
    print("Processing", ...)
    return "end", ...
end

local function finish(...)
    print("Ending", ...)
    return nil, ...
end
```

### Executing the Workflow

The workflower can be executed as a function. Starting from the entry point, each cellâ€™s function is executed, and based on its return value, the next cell in the graph is determined and executed.

```lua
wf()
```

Let's create a practical example of a simple workflow that models a real-world problem. Suppose we want to model a basic customer order processing system. 
The workflow will include steps such as receiving an order, processing payment, checking inventory, and shipping the order.
## Example: Customer Order Processing Workflow
### Cell Functions
- Receive Order: Start the workflow by receiving an order.
- Process Payment: Process the payment for the order.
- Check Inventory: Check if the ordered items are in stock.
- Ship Order: Ship the order if items are in stock.
- Out of Stock: Handle the case where items are out of stock.


```lua
-- Define cell functions
local function receive_order(order)
    print("Order received:", order)
    return "process_payment", order
end

local function process_payment(order)
    print("Processing payment for:", order)
    -- Simulate payment processing
    local payment_successful = true
    if payment_successful then
        return "check_inventory", order
    else
        return "payment_failed", order
    end
end

local function check_inventory(order)
    print("Checking inventory for:", order)
    -- Simulate inventory check
    local in_stock = true
    if in_stock then
        return "ship_order", order
    else
        return "out_of_stock", order
    end
end

local function ship_order(order)
    print("Shipping order:", order)
    -- Simulate order shipment
    return nil  -- End of the workflow
end

local function out_of_stock(order)
    print("Order is out of stock:", order)
    -- Handle out of stock situation
    return nil  -- End of the workflow
end
```
### Let's turn this into a workflow:

```lua
local workflower = require("workflower")

-- Create a new workflower instance
local processOrder = workflower({
    "receive_order",
    {"receive_order", "process_payment", "check_inventory", {"ship_order", "out_of_stock"}},
    receive_order = receive_order,
    process_payment = process_payment,
    check_inventory = check_inventory,
    ship_order = ship_order,
    out_of_stock = out_of_stock
})

-- Execute the workflower with an order
processOrder("Order #12345")
```

Note that `"ship order"` and `"out_of_stock"` are listed in a subarray. This is to declare that they are alternatives and the flow at that point will be decided in realtime based on the internal cell logic preceding it.

## Using Buckets
Buckets in the workflower library are simple state wrappers designed to store and retrieve values during the workflow execution.

You can make one like this:

```lua
local bucket_A, cell_A = workflower.bucket(next_cell_name: string)
```

To use it in a workflow, just pass `cell_A` as another cell and whenever it gets called in the flow, the bucket gets populated with the input at that point.

To access the value in the bucket you can just use `:get()` anywhere. Here's an example.
```lua
local bucket_A, cell_A = workflower.bucket('third_cell')

local flow = workflower({
    'first_cell'
    {'first_cell', 'second_cell', 'bucket_cell', 'third_cell'}
    first_cell = ...,
    ...
    bucket = cell_A,
    third_cell = ...
})

flow(1, 2, 3)
```
This passes through `first_cell` and `second_cell`. Assuming neither cell redirects the flow somewhere else, and doesn't mutate the input, `bucket_cell` would also receive `(1, 2, 3)` and store it in `bucket_A` before passing those values onto `third_cell`.

Which would mean:
```lua
flow(1, 2, 3)
print(bucket_A:get()) 
-- 1, 2, 3
```

## Practical Example: Logging Order Details
Going back to the order example, we can use a bucket to log the order details without affecting the main workflow.

### Cell Functions
- **Receive Order**: Start the workflow by receiving an order.
- **Log Order**: Log the order details using a bucket.
- **Process Payment**: Process the payment for the order.
- **Finish Order**: Complete the workflow.

```lua
-- Create a bucket for logging order details
local order_log_bucket, log_order = workflower.bucket("process_payment")

local processOrder = workflower({
    "receive_order",
    {"receive_order", "log_order", "process_payment", "finish_order"},
    receive_order = receive_order,
    log_order = log_order,
    process_payment = process_payment,
    finish_order = finish_order,
    payment_failed = payment_failed
})

-- Execute the workflower with an order
processOrder("Order #12345")

print("Bucket contents:", order_log_bucket:get())
--[[ 
Order received: Order #12345
Processing payment for: Order #12345
Checking inventory for: Order #12345
Shipping order: Order #12345
Bucket contents: Order #12345
]]
```
## Workflower Inheritance
Of course, since you can instantiate a `Workflower` with parents to inherit from, we can easily rewrite the above example to pass the original `processOrder` as a parent and create a new workflow where the only difference is `log_order`:
```lua
local order_log_bucket, log_order = workflower.bucket("process_payment")

local processOrderAndLog = workflower({
    "receive_order",
    {"receive_order", "log_order", "process_payment", "finish_order"},
    log_order = log_order,
}, processOrder)

processOrderAndLog("Order #12345")
order_log_bucket:get() -- Order #12345
```
**Note** that this would only work if `receive_order` didn't explicitly return its next cell, and instead returned `nil`. When a cell returns `nil` as the first value, the workflow defaults to the order specified in the options it is constructed with.
